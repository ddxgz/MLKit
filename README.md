# Machine Learning Kit for Swift

Early stage of a Machine Learning package implemented in Swift, the current
implemented algorithms are highly relying on [Swift
for Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift). Some of the
implementations refer to [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn).
